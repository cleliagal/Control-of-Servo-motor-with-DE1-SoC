# Control-of-Servo-motor-with-DE1-SoC
This project takes place in the Hardware/Software Platforms lesson in first master in Electrical Engineering of the Faculty of Engineering of Mons.   The goal of this project is to control a servo-motor with a DE1-SoC Board. It introduces you to learn VHDL programming language and to handle an entiere electronical project.

-> Project title: Control of a servo-motor with a DE1-SoC

The goal is to control the servo-motor with the button available on the board by the user. We use a DE1-SoC processor. The software used to create our program is "Quartus II". Our program is separated in three main parts interpreted in VHDL code. 

Here is the connection between the servo-motor and the processor:
